# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a full-stack web development project that aims to recreate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It is designed to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming, web development, RESTful APIs, and deployment principles.

## Project Goals
- Build a command-line interface (CLI) for object creation and data management
- Implement custom classes using Python and OOP principles
- Create a RESTful API for managing data
- Store and retrieve data using a storage engine (File/DB)
- Deploy the web application on a live server

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx, and Ubuntu

Automates deployment and manages infrastructure. Responsibilities include:
- Setting up Docker environments, Nginx configurations, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitoring application performance.
- Managing servers for hosting and deployment.

### 4. Project Manager
Oversees planning, execution, and progress tracking. Responsibilities include:
- Assigning tasks and ensuring timely delivery.
- Coordinating between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
- Managing communication and documentation.

### 5. QA Engineer / Tester
Ensures that the application meets quality standards. Their tasks include:
- Writing test cases for application features.
- Performing manual and automated testing.
- Reporting bugs and ensuring they are resolved.



## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern full-stack development toolkit to efficiently build and deploy a scalable, maintainable AirBnB Clone application.

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.  
**Purpose:** Handles backend logic, URL routing, and RESTful API creation.

### 2. PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system.  
**Purpose:** Stores structured data such as user accounts, bookings, property listings, and reviews.

### 3. GraphQL
A flexible query language for APIs and a runtime for executing queries by using a type system.  
**Purpose:** Allows clients to request only the data they need, improving API performance and developer experience.

### 4. HTML5
The standard markup language for creating web pages.  
**Purpose:** Provides the structure and content of the frontend interface.

### 5. CSS3
A styling language used to describe the look and layout of web documents.  
**Purpose:** Enhances the visual presentation and responsiveness of the frontend UI.

### 6. JavaScript (Vanilla or Frameworks like React)
A scripting language that enables interactive web pages.  
**Purpose:** Implements dynamic content and enhances user interactions on the frontend.

### 7. Django REST Framework (DRF)
A powerful toolkit built on Django for building Web APIs.  
**Purpose:** Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs to enable communication between frontend and backend.

### 8. Docker
A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated containers.  
**Purpose:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 9. Git & GitHub
Version control system and hosting platform for source code.  
**Purpose:** Facilitates collaboration, version management, and code sharing among team members.

### 10. CI/CD Pipelines
A high-performance web server and reverse proxy.  
**Purpose:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


## Database Design

The AirBnB Clone project relies on a relational database structure that captures the core components of the platform, including users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. Below are the main entities, key fields, and their relationships.

### 1. Users
Represents the people who use the platform as either hosts or guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `username`: Login name for the user
- `email`: Contact email
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean indicating if the user can list properties

**Relationships:**
- A user can host multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

---

### 2. Properties
Represents the listings available for booking.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name or short description
- `description`: Full property description
- `location`: Address or area
- `price_per_night`: Rental price

**Relationships:**
- A property is owned by one user (host).
- A property can have multiple bookings.
- A property can receive multiple reviews.

---

### 3. Bookings
Represents reservations made by guests for a property.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: The guest who made the booking
- `property_id`: The property being booked
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

**Relationships:**
- A booking is made by one user for one property.
- A booking can result in a payment.

---

### 4. Payments
Tracks financial transactions related to bookings.

**Key Fields:**

## Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project replicates essential features of the real AirBnB platform to offer users a full-stack booking experience. Each feature contributes to the overall functionality, user interaction, and business logic of the system.

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can act as guests or hosts, with role-based permissions for listing properties or making bookings.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes key details such as location, description, photos, and pricingâ€”making it easier for guests to browse and choose accommodations.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can view availability, select travel dates, and book properties. The system prevents double-booking and ensures that booking rules such as check-in/check-out dates are enforced.

### 4. Payment Integration
Provides secure processing of payments linked to bookings. This feature handles transaction amounts, payment methods, and payment status to ensure financial transparency.

### 5. Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and star ratings for properties theyâ€™ve stayed in. This fosters community trust and helps other users make informed booking decisions.

### 6. Search and Filter
Users can search for properties by location, price range, availability, and other criteria. This improves usability and helps users find listings that meet their needs.

### 7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
