# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a full-stack web development project that aims to recreate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It is designed to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming, web development, RESTful APIs, and deployment principles.

## Project Goals
- Build a command-line interface (CLI) for object creation and data management
- Implement custom classes using Python and OOP principles
- Create a RESTful API for managing data
- Store and retrieve data using a storage engine (File/DB)
- Deploy the web application on a live server
