# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a full-stack web development project that aims to recreate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It is designed to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming, web development, RESTful APIs, and deployment principles.

## Project Goals
- Build a command-line interface (CLI) for object creation and data management
- Implement custom classes using Python and OOP principles
- Create a RESTful API for managing data
- Store and retrieve data using a storage engine (File/DB)
- Deploy the web application on a live server

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx, and Ubuntu

## Team Roles

Successful execution of the AirBnB Clone project requires collaboration across various team roles. Each team member contributes specialized expertise to ensure the functionality, stability, and usability of the final product.

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the core logic of the application. In this project, backend developers:
- Design and implement Python classes and APIs using Flask.
- Handle server-side logic and data processing.
- Ensure integration with storage engines (e.g., file system or databases).

### 2. Frontend Developer
Focuses on the user interface and user experience. Their responsibilities include:
- Creating responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implementing dynamic content rendering.
- Ensuring compatibility across devices and browsers.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database systems and ensures data integrity. In this project, DBAs:
- Design and optimize database schemas.
- Ensure smooth communication between the application and MySQL database.
- Handle data backup, restoration, and security protocols.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Automates deployment and manages infrastructure. Responsibilities include:
- Setting up Docker environments, Nginx configurations, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitoring application performance.
- Managing servers for hosting and deployment.

### 5. Project Manager
Oversees planning, execution, and progress tracking. Responsibilities include:
- Assigning tasks and ensuring timely delivery.
- Coordinating between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
- Managing communication and documentation.

### 6. QA Engineer / Tester
Ensures that the application meets quality standards. Their tasks include:
- Writing test cases for application features.
- Performing manual and automated testing.
- Reporting bugs and ensuring they are resolved.

### 7. UI/UX Designer *(Optional in small teams)*
Responsible for crafting user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. They:
- Design wireframes and mockups.
- Conduct user research to enhance usability.
- Collaborate with frontend developers for accurate implementation.



## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern full-stack development toolkit to efficiently build and deploy a scalable, maintainable AirBnB Clone application.

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.  
**Purpose:** Handles backend logic, URL routing, and RESTful API creation.

### 2. PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system.  
**Purpose:** Stores structured data such as user accounts, bookings, property listings, and reviews.

### 3. GraphQL
A flexible query language for APIs and a runtime for executing queries by using a type system.  
**Purpose:** Allows clients to request only the data they need, improving API performance and developer experience.

### 4. HTML5
The standard markup language for creating web pages.  
**Purpose:** Provides the structure and content of the frontend interface.

### 5. CSS3
A styling language used to describe the look and layout of web documents.  
**Purpose:** Enhances the visual presentation and responsiveness of the frontend UI.

### 6. JavaScript (Vanilla or Frameworks like React)
A scripting language that enables interactive web pages.  
**Purpose:** Implements dynamic content and enhances user interactions on the frontend.

### 7. Django REST Framework (DRF)
A powerful toolkit built on Django for building Web APIs.  
**Purpose:** Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs to enable communication between frontend and backend.

### 8. Docker
A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated containers.  
**Purpose:** Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 9. Git & GitHub
Version control system and hosting platform for source code.  
**Purpose:** Facilitates collaboration, version management, and code sharing among team members.

### 10. Nginx (optional for deployment)
A high-performance web server and reverse proxy.  
**Purpose:** Serves static files and routes traffic to the Django application in a production environment.
